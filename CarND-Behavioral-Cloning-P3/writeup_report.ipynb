    "## Rubric Points\n",
    "### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",
    "* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network \n",
    "* writeup_report.ipynb/.html summarizing the results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 32 and 128 (model.py lines 131-135) \n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 131-135), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 130). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 weight regularization penalties were used in all convolutional layers and all fully-connected layers except the last one. (model.py lines 131-135 & 137-139). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 15-45). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 143). The number of epochs was initially set to five. After each epoch will save a checkpoint of model(model.py line 148-151). After comparation of the five model prediction accuracy and performance in simulaitor, the model after second epoch was choosen as best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving clockwise and counter-clockwise, recovering from the left and right sides of the road, the driving in second track.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the [NVIDIA model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07911.pdf) I thought this model might be appropriate because the NVIDIA model was proved to predict the steering angle well through reading the real kamera images. The architecture was visalized bei NVIDIA below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alte text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training, validation set and test set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I added l2 regulizer to the model and reduced the epoch number instead of using the dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one.  I found the car can drive well on straight road but often steer to less so the car fell off the track. to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I analysed the angle distributin in the data and optimized it to a almost gauss distribution. The original distrubution and adapted one are compared below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "To get close to the gauss distribution, the data with small steering angle was randomly removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road and even almost in the middle of the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes:\n",

    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to steer back to the middel of the road if the car somehow went to the side, which is really possible. These images show what a recovery looks like starting from the right line of lane:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "the car steer back to left \n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "and finally drive in the middle of lane\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I repeated this process in the countclockweise direction to more data points. I also got some data from the second track. But the most data are collected on the first track, where the car is tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I collected the data in clock direction and cuntclcok direction, flipping images is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the collection process, I had 33731 number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by darkening the images randomly and cropped the top and bottom of the images. \n",
    "A original image like that:\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "will be darkened to that:\n",
    "![alt text][image8]\n",
    "then cropped to like that:\n",
    "![alt text][image9]\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 5% of the data into a validation set and 5% into a test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 2 as evidenced by the validation accuracy and the video. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.\n"
